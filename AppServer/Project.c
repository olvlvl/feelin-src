$VER: AppServer 05.00 (2005/12/08)
 
	Most AppServer code has been moved to WinServer. The  shared  object  is
	still used for DnD operations but it'll change in a very near future.
	
$VER: AppServer 04.00 (2005/02/06)
 
	DnD handling rewritten completely (again). Instead of reading  intuition
	messages  on  the  AppServer  thread, I add a FEventHandler, with a very
	high priority, to the window where the DnD begins. Thus I  use  the  new
	event system and receive them through the FM_Widget_HandleEvent method.
   
	Bob routines have been rewritten too. Because  I  was  replacing  screen
	GelsInfo, after a DnD icons operations crashed the system. This is fixed
	now, hopefully :-)
 
$VER AppServer 03.00 (2004/08/13)

	AppServer is now a shared object, because servers are  deprecated  since
	v8 of feelin.library. AppServer is now a subclass of FC_Family.

	AppServer now handles PopHelp and the root FC_Preference object.
